# Data Analyst Portfolio

Hi, I'm Pongsakorn !
This repository is a portfolio of data analyst projects. I've completed projects for self-study, a platform to share my projects, and a way to demonstrate my abilities.

I'm looking for a new challenge as a data analyst right now. I have a deep passion for using technology to resolve key challenges, and I am constantly seeking to improve my skill. I am confident that my knowledge, education, and motivation qualify me for this Data Analyst position.
